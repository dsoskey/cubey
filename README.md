The goal of this cube is to be an unpowered vintage cube that still runs powerful cube cards you would expect to find in a typical vintage cube.  This cube is sized at 540 cards to enable more variation in the card pool, and to ensure that sometimes different archetypes are more or less readily available to the drafters for variation.

# **aggro:** 
Fast aggressive strategies can be found in {W} White, {R} Red. Playing cheap small creatures to chip in early damage, and then using aggo support cards to make the small cheap creatures relevant in the midgame to seal the deal. Creatures like [[Hellrider|7bbfd905-8c71-4389-9174-6e84bcbcf05c]] and [[Drana, Liberator of Malakir]] can be used to take advantage of multiple attacking creatures, and cards like [[Mirror Entity]] can be used make your creatures suddenly larger.

Examples of Early Aggro Cards:
<<[[!Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer|fc898fec-4cc6-4587-b556-c5a8d38ccbd0]][[!Luminarch Aspirant]][[!Seasoned Hallowblade|feb59931-8941-46fb-8e1c-f80ff3730dd9]][[!Goblin Guide|b2e2a777-0705-4a37-937d-c6e020ebc0f0]]>>

Examples of Aggro Mid Game Support:
<<[[!HellRider]][[!Intrepid Adversary|773199f9-c83b-4a77-8342-9f1552ecf595]][[!Steel Seraph|1b6ef5f5-4058-4f89-a573-9e2da87a9f2e]][[!Embercleave|aaae15dd-11b6-4421-99e9-365c7fe4a5d6]]>>

# **tokens go wide:** 
A variation of the aggro strategy is to create a number of tokens which allows you to go around your opponent blockers by overwhelming them with numbers. 

Examples of Token Generators:
<<[[!Hero of Bladehold|8a3853ec-e307-46e0-96d7-0706b5c45c5e]][[!Hanweir Garrison|0900e494-962d-48c6-8e78-66a489be4bb2]][[!JBitterblossom|b9640cbf-b016-410e-9eff-e8924883517b]][[!Deep Forest Hermit|3287775f-7bec-4e8f-bb8d-daf5ce92e4a8]]>>

# **control:** 
Using cards and abilities to limit or control the number of permanents and spells you allow your opponent to control or resolve. {W} White, {U} Blue, {B} Black, and {R} Red are the colors that can be paired together for control style decks. Control decks typically look to win the game with a big finisher once you control the board.

Examples of Single Target Control Staples:
<<[[!Mana Drain|456a2f03-8304-4512-804c-76653e30f436]][[!Oblivion Ring|49577949-b721-40e1-9190-643c5e01b2b5]][[!Infernal Grasp|0655bae1-d33b-4bac-856a-ca4518f192e8]][[!Abrade]]>>

Examples of Control Finishers:
<<[[!Murktide Regent]][[!Archon of Cruelty|1be9d9a4-d7ee-4854-abc2-85cabf993ec9]][[!Grave Titan|5c70da33-ce5d-4b8b-9c1d-9a356a7e196f]][[!Timeless Dragon|d476cc60-e59d-4f34-abc9-f3eafdc2890d]]>>

# **tempo strategies:** 
There are a number of cards you can use to take advantage of slowing down, or pushing your opponent off of their game plan by tapping down their cards, or requiring them to pay resources in order to take the normal game actions they want to take. 

 [[Tangle Wire|74d29b3d-f588-431d-bf4e-f7215683ab39]] is also a tempo based card that can be put into a Death and Taxes style build. This stragey looks for cards that deny your opponet cards on the battlefield while gaining advantages for yourself.

Specific strategies for single tempo cards to deny your opponent lands can be built around cards like, [[Upheaval|7c353e83-4b63-4bc6-b029-273d2eca1f75]], [[Wildfire|c5924430-1904-47b9-bcf0-3379babd395c]], [[Burning of Xinye|edb86d0d-e6cf-4988-a03e-26d52d78d929]] and [[Armageddon|63e00d79-cc6c-41ad-ab2c-0a6596e0e5b7]]. By combining any of these cards with a number of mana rocks, you can destroy all lands/ or bounce all cards back to players hands, and then cast spells with your mana rocks. This can lead to you creating a huge new tempo advantage over your opponent. 

Examples of Tempo Based Cards:
<<[[!Opposition|de069a00-be1f-4762-b511-bb9211bf2cc8]][[!Thalia, Guardian of Thraben|c9f8b8fb-1cd8-450e-a1fe-892e7a323479]][[!Esper Sentinel]]>>

# **hand striping:** 
An impotant aspect to both control and resource denial stragies is hand stripping. Taking the key card or piece of a combo out of an opponets hand can in some cases win you the game on the spot. 

Examples of Hand striping cards:
<<[[!Thoughtseize|1ecc64b6-6f2c-4b20-aa80-54cc47382606]][[!Inquisition of Kozilek|6a3ff5c3-0fdb-4d54-b4e5-ce7bad9953f0]][[!Duress|e69f6e05-f39b-4eee-89a3-400ca5adf8a3]][[!Deep-Cavern Bat|69c68c95-b788-43b1-9f22-1b22c5a00b25]][[!Frogkin Kidnapper]][[!Grief|ea859431-c1bf-4d07-9845-430bc217cb91]][[!Collective Brutality|cb94a02f-4660-45b6-8a39-941b710cf8f3]][[!Hymn to Tourach|f4089e6c-51eb-44c4-8395-68e43cbed93d]]>>

# **ramp strategies:** 
Found mostly in Green {G}, ramp strategies focus on different ways to produce extra mana so they can play larger creatures and spells quicker then their opponents. Players can produce extra mana by either playing small creatures that also produce mana, by playing mana rocks and artifacts that produce extra mana, and using abilities that allow them to put extra lands into place.

Examples of Ramp cards:
<<[[!Elvish Mystic|9a9da45b-54ae-49c1-af50-8b88912c5bcd]][[!Gruul Signet|0310bb0e-bd22-470e-8711-4e15aec86578]][[!Mana Vault|a941b1f6-9f18-4c9e-993f-bf8f52bd6f53]][[!Fastbond|64b52b42-e2af-4040-b7ba-34cc292af7ef]]>>

Examples of Ramp Pay Offs:
<<[[!Woodfall Primus|5da88d23-8650-4b55-a3f9-e964427660ed]][[!Dragonlord Atarka|ce0c3b45-cf1d-4d85-9fe3-fb26b4b15dfd]][[!Worldspine Wurm|ada90827-f11b-495b-8962-66dd6345b454]][[!Kozilek, Butcher of Truth|067fac91-2483-4678-b86a-2c54a3a480cf]]>>

# **reanimation strategies:** 
Ways to reanimate creatures can be found in Black {B}, with enabler cards in Blue {U}, and Red {R} . Spells to enable the overall strategy can be found in all 5 colors. The goal of this strategy is to put large creatures into your graveyard, and then by using a reanimation spell, to put the large creature onto the battlefield for cheaper than its mana cost. This style of play relies on 3 different types of cards, 1.) Discard Outlets/Looters, 2.) Reanimation Spells, and 3.) Large Creatures to reanimate. 

Examples of Discard Options:
<<[[!Bitter Triumph|05bdd22c-3e11-4c29-bdfa-d3dfc0e90a9f]][[!Cabal Initiate|b279a03f-85ab-43f2-b5ca-1bc10563e5ad]][[!Thirst for Knowledge|6143015a-d1d0-4572-9c43-b91cc49a6c92]][[!Faithless Looting|4e0865d7-3325-489f-bbe6-b7d2a43c23af]]>>

# **cheating things into play:** 
In this cube there are a number of both spells and permanents that allow players to place different kinds of permanents onto the battlefield without casting them (typically known as cheating things into play). These kinds of cards are typically found in Blue {U}, Red {R}, and Green {G} in this cube. Most of these spells and abilities have certain requirements as to the kind of permanent they can put into play. A build around style card in this category is [[Tinker|7da23b15-dfb8-4267-9b33-d7a4c035c434]] which allows a player to place an artifact card from their deck onto the battlefield, and functions best when you prioritize drafting artifact targets the spell can seek out. Another readition to the cube has been [[Flash|d31459c2-9656-4e9a-bb72-71a910e8570b]] to take advantage of enter the battlefield ablities of creatures. Pairing this card with reanimation, or effects like [[Ephemerate|f48ab69d-8a01-4dcb-af70-31e2c62278df]] or [[Mimic Vata|736fff86-2417-4a77-b8eb-be2d1d142a9f]] are a good ways to get the creature back after Flash resolves.

# **spells matters:** 
Is a stragey that is very oftern a very Column A and Column B archytpye. In Column A you have cards like [[Young Pyromancer|e63195ed-5c3e-40e8-9cc2-5cbc1faf7f7f]] and [[Saheeli, Sublime Artificer|5662d0a5-3222-4ab9-9e15-f06477730b75]] that give you pay offs for playing spells from column B like [[Brainstorm|84e0da5b-0916-4dd6-99a2-a58e9d83bb26]] or [[Cathartic Pyre|49c23880-df11-4e62-bb9c-af7cd64c81d3]]. The tricky thing about this style of deck is having enough cards from each category and getting them in the right order.

# **threat stealing and clones:** 
Why play a win condition when you can take your opponets? This strategy works particularly well in a control shell and most commonly means you need to be playing {U}. This stragey only works when it comes to stealing creature threats from your opponet. Enchantments like [[Control Magic|c7e90849-ca7a-4f66-871e-1cb4b59aefcf]] and [[Treachery|613694aa-b169-400d-8063-2b83d8303611]] are aura based ways to take your opponets big creatures. [[Bribery|99c7c1d0-dc6b-413f-8346-54728a4c7b14]] and [[Fractured Identity|8db735ea-f9cf-4e3c-9200-4f180df55baa]] are spell based was to take winning creatures away to your side of the game as well. There are some ways to take other specific things that are not creatures as well listed bellow.

Clones are another great way to double up on your stuff or share in good things your opponent is doing. [[Phantasmal Image|98e7bf8f-dba7-4005-8cee-634c9153931d]], [[Phyrexian Metamorph|d6afeb07-ed44-4e15-99b6-436f8365326f]], [[Mirage Mirror|cb1252c2-b951-4125-93a2-9282b607b6a4]] are all great ways to get a copy or a second copy of creature.

# **lands matter and land win conditions:**
There are some decks that can be built in this cube that focuses around utility lands in a number of ways in order to gain advantages or win the game. Alot of these decks work best in base {G} with {R} and {B} as support colors. Two such particular stargeies are either decks built around [[Field of the Dead|470ca3f4-29aa-4c4c-8ff2-8cdd70c69943]], or the [[Dark Depths|f78398af-06b7-41f8-8aaa-81800f490121]] Combo. 

Field of the Dead decks want to play 7 diffrent named lands to start creating Zombie tokens, and then set up an engine to sacrfice the lands and recast them out of the graveyard. Cards like [[Ramunap Excavator|e62ff2bf-323d-4252-ba7b-27bcdf805093]] or [[Crucible of Worlds|db2da622-872b-4dc2-8d9b-284601b9c38e]] to bring sacrfice lands like [[Fable Passage|e374f1a8-0b90-4f62-9af5-3bbb11a0fbc4]] or [[Prismatic Vista|e37da81e-be12-45a2-9128-376f1ad7b3e8]].

Recycleable land destruction with [[Strip Mine|2bbff39f-f16b-4ae5-aa99-da5bdf482c33]] or [[Wasteland|bd53f7e3-f76a-440b-8c84-994d378bda97]] pairs really well with all the same cards that make field of the dead work.

Dark Depths Combo involves playing the [[Dark Depths|f78398af-06b7-41f8-8aaa-81800f490121]] land and using either [[Vampire Hexmage|97ec2e55-fa60-4ee1-b9c0-e6b84939697b]] or [[Thespian Stage|269a926d-7788-4668-8bd8-7572dbf5f5eb]] to remove all the counters, or make a copy that has no counters and becomes a gigantinc game winning creature.

[[Urza's Sage|c1e0f201-42cb-46a1-901a-65bb4fc18f6c]] and [[Thespian Stage|269a926d-7788-4668-8bd8-7572dbf5f5eb]] also work together in a combo. By first having Thespian Stage become a copy of Urza Saga it procedes to move through the saga stages. When the 3rd lore trigger is on the stack if you then turn Thespian stage into another land it will retain the {2}{T} to create Construct tokens without sacrficing itself.

An infinate life combo hidding in the lands package is [[Fastbond|c71123b5-6be5-4c3c-972a-0aad3db1a694]],[[Zuran Orb|2ad373f3-c5f9-44a0-bbc4-518f80b08cfd]] and either [[Crucible of Worlds|7f4893ef-f983-418b-b7a4-5f073c844545]] or [[Ramunap Excavator|e62ff2bf-323d-4252-ba7b-27bcdf805093]].

# **wheels draw sevens and payoffs:** 
A long time staple of MTG Cube are cards that allow you and your opponet to discard your hands and both draw 7 new cards. There are lots of ways in which you can make drawing these new cards more advantageous for you then for your opponet, hurting your opponet when they draw the cards, or stoping you opponet drawing their new hand after discarding what they have. This strategy is very much another card from column A paired with card from column B style game Play"
